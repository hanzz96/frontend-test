# Project Name

## Description

This is Technical assessment for a company.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following versions of Node.js and npm installed:

- **Node.js version:** `18.20.4`
- **npm version:** `10.7.0`

To verify your installed versions of Node.js and npm, run the following commands:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```
## Git Section:
- **Git clone instructions** have been added to explain how to clone the project repository. I provided a git url (`https://github.com/hanzz96/frontend-test.git`) in case you want to clone the project instead of downloading the zip file.
